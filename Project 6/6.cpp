// Write a Program That Uses a Structure Called Point to Model a Point. Define Three Points
// and Have the User Input Values to Two of Them. Then Set the Third Point Equal to the
// Sum of the Other Two, and Display the Value of the New Point. Interaction with the 
// Program Might Look Like This:
// Enter Coordinates for P1: 3 4 
// Enter Coordinates for P2: 5 7 
// Coordinates of P1 + P2 are: 8, 11
